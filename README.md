# Haimap-cold-seep-microbial-diversity
Here we investigated the diversity of microeukaryotic and prokaryotic diversity using both DNA and RNA signatures.
We uploaded an integrated R code file with all analyses, allowing for a continuous analysis, using the two files of community data (ASV table).
R code: "coldseep RNA DNA 0-10cm.R"

Community Data: "asv_18s.txt" for microeukaryotes,
                 "asv_table_16s.txt" for prokaryotes
                 
Taxonomy file: "taxonomy-18s.tsv" for prokaryotes
              "taxonomy-16s.tsv" for prokaryotes

Metadata: "SEM_data_for_16S.csv" which contains all environmental data and calculated richness
